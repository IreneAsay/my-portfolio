## User Story

As a user when I open the NetTimeTraveler application. I see an input for a search field for a [Year between 2000 and 2020]. When I enter the year a Giphy from the movie “Back to the Future”appears and it takes me back through the internet archives and a random website that correlates with the year I entered loads on the screen and a random book with a publish year that matches the input year appears on the screen beside the website from the internet archives. Then as a user my life is complete.
