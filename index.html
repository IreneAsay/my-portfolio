                            <p>I believe there is always room for improvement in each project and in everyday
                                leadership. With nearly 10 years of project management experience (3+ years in a top
                                10 U.S. software company), I excel in monitoring project resources and deliverables
                                from inception to completion. My multilingual skills (English, Chinese, and Taiwanese)
                                enables me to coordinate with individuals of different cultural backgrounds more easily.
                                My ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams
                                continuously helps me deliver
                                high-quality products. </p>

                            <p>I successfully increased the workforce productivity, shortened project turnaround
                                time and new project managers onboarding time at various roles. Working with
                                numerous vendors and external stakeholders gave me opportunities to better
                                understand the clients’ needs. In addition, I have a Master of Education from the
                                University of Southern California and I am a national certified Project Management
                                Professional (PMP®), Certified ScrumMaster (CSM®) and Certified Product Owner
                                (CSPO®). Furthermore, I am currently enrolled in the Georgia Institute of Technology
                                Full Stack Coding Bootcamp to enhance my technical skills. My educational background,
                                experience, and certifications equip me with effective communication skills, project
                                management techniques, and technical mindset for a variety of product development
                                environments.

                                <p>What makes me unique is my involvement in diversity initiatives at different
                                    companies. I care about diversity at the workplace and I enjoy promoting
                                    cultural awareness. I also do volunteer work to give back to my community and I
                                    respect people who do the same. </p>

                                    <p> I am blessed with two beautiful kids who are both bilingual in English and
                                        Chinese. Most of my family are in Taiwan and most of my husband's family are in
                                        California, so we love Taiwanese cuisine as much as Mexican food.
